Info for Image Makers using MV

1) mhwepg

If you package MV with your image, please remember to include
the mhwepg binary! I get lots of queries from people where
they can find the binary...

2) Including a conf.bin with image

If you want to include an MV conf.bin with your image
(i.e. deliver a pre-configured MV), make
sure 'Auto' is set for the data directories in the Input Menu
(accessed via the DREAM key).

If you don't, MV will be unable to set it's data directories
appropriate to each user's system, and they may get all
sorts of errors e.g. complaining about e.g. "can't make
directory /var/mnt/usb/mv"

3) Default-configured downloads

In order to allow image makers to configure download inputs
as default, I've added code that ignores such configured
inputs if no network is configured.

4) Passing Arguments to MV

MV reads a key in the enigma config on startup, allowing
image makers to pass it arguments.

You set the key like this:

	eConfig::getInstance()->setKey("/elitedvb/mv/arg1", <VALUE> );

<VALUE> is interpreted as follows:

1-9:	Start in that view number
	These allow e.g. always start with the program list
	for the current channel if the red button is pressed
	on the remote.
	This argument overrides the config setting 'Next View'.

Other values are ignored currently.
	
Important:

The key will be set to 0 once it's been read, meaning
you have to set it every time you want to pass an
argument.
